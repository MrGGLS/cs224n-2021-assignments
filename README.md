All these codes work well in my machine and colab.

## Course Website

[Stanford CS 224N | Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)

## Setting Environment

Take a look at the xx.pdf in each assignment

## About Written Assignments

Sorry about that, I only finished assignment 2... (Math is so hard)

## About GPU?

It's fine to run those codes without gpu before assignment 4&5

You don't need have a gpu (of course better to have one) if you have a account of google colaboratory, which can provide you free  but limited gpu usage. And you can trust me, this is enough for this course

## Demo for A4&A5
